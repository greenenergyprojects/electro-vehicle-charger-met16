## Bugfixes / Improvements on pcb


| Reference      | Description                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R31            | Add pull down 100K fom net PWM to GND                                         |
|                | (otherwise U6A-1 may oscillate when PWM not driven                            |
| U4, U5, U6     | PCB footprint more narrow                                                     |
| D1, D5, D8, D9 | Take footprint for small schottky diode (1A)                                  |
| R27, R28       | Change to 2 serial resistors (better value adjustment)                        |
| R29            | 47K -> 3K3                                                                     |
| R23            | 1K -> 10K                                                                     |
| C9             | 100n -> 1n                                                                    |
| U4             | Change Text ACS712 -> ACS712-30A 2.5V|66mV/A (or ACS712-20A 2.5V|100mV/A)     |
| R7             | Change 10K -> 5K6 or Trimmer 10K instead of R4,R7 (voltage offset adjustment) |
| LCD drills     | increase horizontal distance app. 0.5mm                                       |


## Test results

### voltage / current sensors

Phase angle between voltage and current signal is approximatly 27Â° on pure resistance load (voltage meets zero point before current).
For power/energy measurment correction on software level needed.
